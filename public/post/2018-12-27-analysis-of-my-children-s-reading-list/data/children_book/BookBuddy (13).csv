""Some of the best children's books ever written have been about girls -- like The Paper Bag Princess."" - The New York Times  In the fall of 1980, Annick Press first published Robert Munsch's tale of a dragon, a princess named Elizabeth, and the bum of a prince she rescues. Playfully illustrated by Michael Martchenko, and full of Munsch's now-famous wit, the book was an instant success and has since sold millions of copies in dozens of languages all over the world.
