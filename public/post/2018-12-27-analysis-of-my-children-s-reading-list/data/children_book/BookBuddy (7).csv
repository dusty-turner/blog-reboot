The Alphabet from A to Y with Bonus Letter Z!,,,,,Steve Martin,"Martin, Steve",,,,,Flying Dolphin Press,,2007,,Juvenile Fiction,"The acclaimed entertainer and bestselling author Steve Martin and the wildly clever New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast team up in a weird, wonderful excursion through the alphabet. The ABCs have never had it so good. Created by two of today's wittiest, most imaginative minds, The Alphabet from A to Y with Bonus Letter Z! is a sheer delight from A to Z. In twenty-six alliterative couplets, Steve Martin conjures up much more than mere apples and zebras. Instead we meet Horace the hare, whose hairdo hides hunchbacks, and Ollie the owl, who owed Owen an oboe. Roz Chast contributes the perfect visual settings for Martin's zany two-liners. Her instantly recognizable drawings are packed with humorous touches both broad and subtle. Each rereading—and there will be many—delivers new delights and discoveries. There, hidden behind Bad Baby Bubbleducks, is a framed picture of a beatnik holding balloons; and the letter C finds clunky Clarissa all clingy and clueless adrift in a landscape cluttered with images ranging from a curiously comfortable clown to Chuck's Chili stand. A smart, laugh-inducing introduction to the alphabet for young children, The Alphabet from A to Y with Bonus Letter Z! will also enchant adults with its matchless mix of the sophisticated and the silly.",,,,,,,52,,,,,English,,,,9780385516624,0,0,,Unread,,,,,,,0,,,,2018/09/13 08:54:51.451645016,,,,,,twfOgWjz6ZMC,,0,,
