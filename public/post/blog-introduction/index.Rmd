As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.  

Creating this blog serves several purposes. 

1.  It archives some projects I've created.
2.  It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.  
3.  It helps me share what I've learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.  

During the proces of learning how `blogdown` works, I saw this timely tweet from [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob)
