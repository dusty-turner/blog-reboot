      <description>The Goal of this AnalysisOne of my superpowers is being a bad fantasy football manager. My motivation for this analysis is to show how I’m not actually that bad - but rather unlucky. To show this, I created this post.
Below I summarize how I got the data, the information I can glean from the data, share the link to this analysis for my league, and share the code so you can do it to.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN’s New V3 API for Private Leagues: How We Got HereThis marks post 3 of n of my 2019 ESPN Fantasy Football blog posts. In the last few months, ESPN upgraded their API from V2 to V3, breaking all of our previous work accessing and analysing the data from the API.
In my last two posts, I explored how to access data from ESPN’s V3 API for public leagues.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN Fantasy Football for Private LeaguesIn my previous post, I explained how to access the ESPN Fantasy Football’s new (V3) public API. But what if your league manager does not make the league public? Are you out of luck?
In this post I’ll explain how to pass ‘cookies’ to ESPN and access private league data.
To accomplish this, we’ll use…
