      <description>Introduction&#xD;I’ve been looking for an all-in-one place to explain how to start from nothing to having a GPU-accelerated machine learning platform that runs RStudio Server with TensorFlow through reticulate.&#xA;In this post, I will explain how to…&#xA;Set up an EC2 instance in AWS with GPU capabilities&#xD;Install RStudio Server with the latest versions of R&#xD;Install the correct versions of Python with Recitulate&#xD;Install TensorFlow and Keras to run deep learning models&#xD;Set up an EC2 instance&#xD;Log in to AWS&#xD;For a new account, select “Root User”.</description>

      <description>Quick Start Guide to Neural Networks in R with Keras and Tensorflow&#xD;I’ve been working with neural networks lately and have struggled to find any quick start resources for getting up and running in R. To help others in a similar situation, I’m providing this quick start guide. It’s designed to help you get your first model up and going, enabling you to iterate quickly with your own data.</description>

      <description>Every year, the great team at Advent of Code lead by ericwastl develops an “Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.”&#xA;Well, I like R, so in this post I will provide my solutions to the puzzles each day. I plan on using this post to learn and teach and hopefully I am able to stay up-to-date!</description>
