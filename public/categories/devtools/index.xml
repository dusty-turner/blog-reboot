      <description>InspirationAt the 2019 New York R Conference, Emily Robinson gave a great talk called “Everything You Wanted to Know About Making R Packages but Were Afraid to Ask” (Note: This link will be live once the video is published).
Emily Robinson is one of my ‘heros of R.’ I was honored to host her several years back a the United States Military Academy when she came to present her work on A/B Testing during her time at Esty.</description>
