      <description>A Tribute!&#xD;Since the dawn of time, people have been developing human-like attachments to their transportation. I imagine Moses naming his chariot, Noah his ark, and maybe even Jesus naming his borrowed donkey.&#xA;Well, maybe I’m taking too much historical license, but man’s affinity for their transportation remains.&#xA;At the age of 21, my dad and I split the cost of a 2005 Ford F150. The odometer read ~24,000 miles and it set us back ~$20,000.</description>
