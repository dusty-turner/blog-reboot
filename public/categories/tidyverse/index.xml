      <description>Introduction&#xD;In part 1 of this series, I will demonstrate how to interact with the Fitbit API in R.&#xA;Huge credit to Matt Kaye for creating the fitbitr package that provides an interface between R and the Fitbit API. If you are familiar with R and you have a Fitbit, you should have success following what I have laid out below.&#xA;Install the fitbitr package&#xD;From CRAN:&#xA;install.packages(&amp;quot;fitbitr&amp;quot;)&#xD;Or the development version from github:</description>

      <description>Peloton R&#xD;In part 1 of my Peloton API post, I explored the pelotonR created by Ben Weiher’s. It’s a great package for accessing your Peloton data and I recommend it.&#xA;In part 2, I’ll explore a different pelotonR package from Laura Ellis. She provides a great tutorial to display the functionality. I recommend this one too!&#xA;Objectives&#xD;The objectives for this post are to…&#xA;Show how awesome my wife is.</description>

      <description>Motivation&#xD;Like many, COVID-19 completely altered our lives as the virus spread across the country and became a mainstay in our society. Though my family and I have been spared of tragedy, we’ve had to find ways to replace kid’s activities, work routines, and social interactions with other (hopefully) enriching activities… Like family games.&#xA;Ticket to Ride caused a lot of strife between my kids :)&#xD;One thing that we’ve added to our new normal is watching “The Price is Right” after dinner.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN’s New V3 API for Private Leagues: How We Got Here&#xD;This marks post 3 of n of my 2019 ESPN Fantasy Football blog posts. In the last few months, ESPN upgraded their API from V2 to V3, breaking all of our previous work accessing and analysing the data from the API.&#xA;In my last two posts, I explored how to access data from ESPN’s V3 API for public leagues.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN Fantasy Football for Private Leagues&#xD;In my previous post, I explained how to access the ESPN Fantasy Football’s new (V3) public API. But what if your league manager does not make the league public? Are you out of luck?&#xA;In this post I’ll explain how to pass ‘cookies’ to ESPN and access private league data.&#xA;To accomplish this, we’ll use…&#xA;Python&#xD;retriculate&#xD;purrr&#xD;Python?!&#xD;Yes - Believe it or not, though I’m an avid R user, I believe in using the best tool for the job.</description>

      <description>ESPN’s New API (V3)&#xD;In previous seasons, we’ve enjoyed relatively easy access to ESPN’s fantasy sports data. Sometime in the last few months, ESPN altered/upgraded their AP to V3.&#xA;As I’ve tried to replicate previous analysis, old methods accessing the V2 API no longer work.&#xA;Credit Where Credit Is Due&#xD;Quick crash course on ESPN’s new #fantasyfootball API, #python focused — https://t.co/bwPLJLDpmk pic.twitter.com/exi2NKLXV3&#xD;— Steven Morse (@thestevemo) August 1, 2019&#xD;I must also credit this reddit thread where one of the users shared the URL with end points that provide the all the available data requests for the API (as far as I can tell).</description>

      <description>Introduction&#xD;Over Christmas 2017, my wife, Jill, resolved that our family (to include babysitters) would read our children over 1000 new books in 2018. More specifically, 29 December 2017 - 28 December 2018.&#xA;A goal like this takes dedication, love, and of course, a Data Science-y approach.&#xA;Special thanks to Ally, Zia, and Bookbuddy for help in accomplishing this goal!&#xA;Also, special thanks to drob and juliasilge who privde the tidytext package and the entire R open-source community I rely on to do this analysis.</description>

      <description>A Little About Dates in R&#xD;Before we launch into any analysis that contains dates, we should know a few important nuggets about how R handles date-like objects.&#xA;There are 3 date/time classes are built in to R&#xA;- Date&#xA;- POSIXct&#xA;- POSIXlt&#xA;Base R&#xD;First, base R can read a string of text and convert it to a date class. To help it read the date, you must tell R what date format your character string should expect.</description>
