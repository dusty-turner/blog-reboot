      <description>Intro&#xD;As I near the end of my PhD, my advisor David Kahle submitted my information to the Mathematics Genealogy Project. It was pretty cool to explore the academic lineage I come from — sort of like discovering a scholarly family tree. With some help from ChatGPT, I put together a script to scrape and visualize my genealogy.&#xA;Since most of the code was generated through a series of back-and-forths with GPT, I won’t walk through every line here, but you can expand the code block below if you’re curious.</description>

      <description>Every year, the great team at Advent of Code lead by ericwastl develops an “Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.”&#xA;Well, I like R, so in this post I will provide my solutions to the puzzles each day. I plan on using this post to learn and teach and hopefully I am able to stay up-to-date!</description>

      <description>Introduction&#xD;Over Christmas 2017, my wife, Jill, resolved that our family (to include babysitters) would read our children over 1000 new books in 2018. More specifically, 29 December 2017 - 28 December 2018.&#xA;A goal like this takes dedication, love, and of course, a Data Science-y approach.&#xA;Special thanks to Ally, Zia, and Bookbuddy for help in accomplishing this goal!&#xA;Also, special thanks to drob and juliasilge who privde the tidytext package and the entire R open-source community I rely on to do this analysis.</description>

      <description>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.&#xA;Creating this blog serves several purposes.&#xA;It archives some projects I’ve created.&#xD;It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.&#xA;It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</description>
