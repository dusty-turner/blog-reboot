      <description>Peloton R&#xD;In part 1 of my Peloton API post, I explored the pelotonR created by Ben Weiher’s. It’s a great package for accessing your Peloton data and I recommend it.&#xA;In part 2, I’ll explore a different pelotonR package from Laura Ellis. She provides a great tutorial to display the functionality. I recommend this one too!&#xA;Objectives&#xD;The objectives for this post are to…&#xA;Show how awesome my wife is.</description>

Since then, she’s been going hard and I have been trying to keep up when the weather is bad or injuries keep me from running.&#xA;Jill Smiling After Her 600th Ride (and new record)!&#xD;Over the last few months, a few works projects have taught me a lot about purrr, functional programming, collaborative projects, and APIs.</description>
