      <description>Motivation&#xD;Like many, COVID-19 completely altered our lives as the virus spread across the country and became a mainstay in our society. Though my family and I have been spared of tragedy, we’ve had to find ways to replace kid’s activities, work routines, and social interactions with other (hopefully) enriching activities… Like family games.&#xA;Ticket to Ride caused a lot of strife between my kids :)&#xD;One thing that we’ve added to our new normal is watching “The Price is Right” after dinner.</description>

      <title>A Farewell Ode To My Old Grey Truck</title>

      <description>A Tribute!&#xD;Since the dawn of time, people have been developing human-like attachments to their transportation. I imagine Moses naming his chariot, Noah his ark, and maybe even Jesus naming his borrowed donkey.&#xA;Well, maybe I’m taking too much historical license, but man’s affinity for their transportation remains.&#xA;At the age of 21, my dad and I split the cost of a 2005 Ford F150. The odometer read ~24,000 miles and it set us back ~$20,000.</description>

      <description>The Goal of this Analysis&#xD;One of my superpowers is being a bad fantasy football manager. My motivation for this analysis is to show how I’m not actually that bad - but rather unlucky. To show this, I created this post.&#xA;Below I summarize how I got the data, the information I can glean from the data, share the link to this analysis for my league, and share the code so you can do it to.</description>

      <title>Parallel Processing and Bootstrapping</title>

      <description>Introduction&#xD;Often times, I run simulations on my computer to help educate my students about different statistical topics. In doing this, I often end up running fairly “long” simulations that take up more time than what I’d like to use in the classrooms.&#xA;Complaining about this let me to Googling, which, as usual, let me to a solution. Posted below is an example of what I learned with an accompanying ShinyApp which helps me explain bootstrapping to my students.</description>

      <description>Inspiration&#xD;At the 2019 New York R Conference, Emily Robinson gave a great talk called “Everything You Wanted to Know About Making R Packages but Were Afraid to Ask” (Note: This link will be live once the video is published).&#xA;Emily Robinson is one of my ‘heros of R.’ I was honored to host her several years back a the United States Military Academy when she came to present her work on A/B Testing during her time at Esty.</description>

      <title>2018 Mathlete Fantasy Football Analysis</title>

      <description>Introduction&#xD;In my previous post, I worked through how to get your league information from the ESPN and YAHOO APIs.&#xA;The motivation for this project was to compare two leagues performances over the 2018 fantasy football season. As the ring leader of the West Point Department of Mathematical Sciences fantasy football league, we had 20 managers. This, of course, is too many for one league so we split the teams across two leagues.</description>

      <description>A Little About Dates in R&#xD;Before we launch into any analysis that contains dates, we should know a few important nuggets about how R handles date-like objects.&#xA;There are 3 date/time classes are built in to R&#xA;- Date&#xA;- POSIXct&#xA;- POSIXlt&#xA;Base R&#xD;First, base R can read a string of text and convert it to a date class. To help it read the date, you must tell R what date format your character string should expect.</description>

      <description>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.&#xA;Creating this blog serves several purposes.&#xA;It archives some projects I’ve created.&#xD;It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.&#xA;It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</description>
