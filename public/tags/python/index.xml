      <description>IntroductionI’ve been looking for an all-in-one place to explain how to start from nothing to having a GPU-accelerated machine learning platform that runs RStudio Server with TensorFlow through reticulate.
In this post, I will explain how to…
Set up an EC2 instance in AWS with GPU capabilitiesInstall RStudio Server with the latest versions of RInstall the correct versions of Python with RecitulateInstall TensorFlow and Keras to run deep learning modelsSet up an EC2 instanceLog in to AWSFor a new account, select “Root User”.</description>
