Halloween,,,,,Jerry Seinfeld,"Seinfeld, Jerry",,,,,"Little, Brown",,2002,,Juvenile Fiction,"If the only ""really clear thought"" you had as a kid was ""Get candy,""you'll be at one with comedian Jerry Seinfeld's first children's picture book,Halloween. This nostalgic view of Halloweens past will ring true witheveryone who remembers the trials and tribulations of trick-or-treating--fromthe stupid masks with thin gray rubber straps and cheap little staples to thehumiliation of having to wear a winter coat over your store-bought Supermancostume. Of course, the smart-alecky Seinfeld puts his own stamp on things in avoice that is so distinctly his: ""Come on lady, let's go! Halloween, doorbells,candy, let's pick it up in there."" He wants ""name candy"" only, make no mistake,and even trick-or-treats with an organizational cabinet on wheels, with drawerslabeled ""Crunchy Things,"" ""Sour Things,"" ""Rejects,"" etc. James Bennett'sexaggerated, hilarious, expressive illustrations of the young Jerry (yes, itlooks exactly like him) suit the over-the-top story to a T. Unusualchild's-eye perspectives on parents (and friends up the sidewalk who won't waitup) add energy to a book that is already sugar-charged. Like Jerry's standuproutines, Halloween focuses on the minutiae and will make you laugh evenif you try to resist.
