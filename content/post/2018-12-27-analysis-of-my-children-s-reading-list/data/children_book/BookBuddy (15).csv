Many,,The Diversity of Life on Earth,,,Nicola Davies,"Davies, Nicola",,,,,Candlewick Press,11/7/2017,2017,,JUVENILE NONFICTION,"After magnifying the beauty of unseen organisms in Tiny Creatures, Nicola Davies and Emily Sutton turn their talents to the vast variety of life on Earth.  The more we study the world around us, the more living things we discover every day. The planet is full of millions of species of plants, birds, animals, and microbes, and every single one -- including us -- is part of a big, beautiful, complicated pattern. When humans interfere with parts of the pattern, by polluting the air and oceans, taking too much from the sea, and cutting down too many forests, animals and plants begin to disappear. What sort of world would it be if it went from having many types of living things to having just one? In a beautiful follow-up, the creators of the award-winning Tiny Creatures: The World of Microbes deliver an inspiring look at the extraordinary diversity of Earth's inhabitants -- and the importance of their preservation.",,,,,,,40,,,,,English,,,,9.78076E+12,0,0,,Unread,,,,,,,0,,,,30:57.5,,,,,,piQtDwAAQBAJ,,0,,
