Was honored to speak at this years [2018 New York R Conference](https://www.rstats.nyc/) hosted by [Lander Analytics](https://www.landeranalytics.com/) and [Work-Bench](https://www.work-bench.com/).  [Jared Lander](https://twitter.com/jaredlander) sure knows how to host a good party, I mean, conference.
