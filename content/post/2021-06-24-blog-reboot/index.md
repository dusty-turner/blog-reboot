Friends - you may notice my blog if missing a few historical posts. The underlying open source software I'm using to build this blog undertook enough updates (for the better) that my patchwork site built on a house of cards came tumbling down.

I learned a lot in the process (which is the reason for even having a blog) and I'm reviving it.  I'm removing some pages that I just can't resussatate and consolodating some others (namly those about presentations).  Of those I can save, I'm leaving them largely the same even if I am a little embarassed at how 2017 me did the code.  

Thanks and beat navy!
