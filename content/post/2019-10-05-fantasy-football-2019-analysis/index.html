<h3>The Goal of this Analysis</h3>
<p>One of my superpowers is being a bad fantasy football manager. My motivation for this analysis is to show how I’m not actually that bad - but rather unlucky. To show this, I created this post.</p>
<p>Below I summarize how I got the data, the information I can glean from the data, share the link to this analysis for my league, and share the code so you can do it to.</p>
<p>There’s not any code in this post. The code I used to create the dashboard of analysis (pictured below) is on this github repo <a href="https://github.com/dusty-turner/ESPN-V3">dusty-turner/ESPN-V3</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the repo (and code) are quite messy. I hope to clean it up over the coming weeks.</p>

<h3>League Analysis</h3>
<p><a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/fantasyfootball2019/fantasy-football-league-dashboard">League Analysis Dashboard</a></p>
<p>At the above link, you’ll fine a dashboard that will show analysis from my league. It includes the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Identify the top and bottom teams every week. In my league we give a mug to the top points scorer and a plunger for the bottom dweller.</p></li>
<li><p>Show a graphic to see who is over performing (or under performing) according to their record.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyse whose players are over/under performing according to ESPN’s projections. Another way to look at this is examining how accurate ESPN’s projections are. Along with this - If every team played their optimal lineup, what would their record be.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, I created a couple of miscellaneous observations. I created a histogram of how accurate ESPN’s predictions are by position. Also, I created a radar chart to show how each team ranks in scoring at each position compared to the other teams.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I plan to add more as the season progresses (and I have time).</p>

<p>For each team, I created a markdown report analyzing their performance. Here is the analysis I currently have for each team:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Short league summary depicting if the selected team earned the top (or bottom) points scorer award.</p></li>
<li><p>A visualization showing how well each player performed according to their expectation. Also a sortable table of this graphic.</p></li>
<li><p>A listing of the optimal lineup and how badly the manager missed this lineup.</p></li>
<li><p>A radar chart showing how well each position performed compared to all previous weeks.</p></li>
</ol>
