<p>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.</p>
<p>Creating this blog serves several purposes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It archives some projects I’ve created.</li>
<li>It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.<br />
</li>
<li>It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the proces of learning how <code>blogdown</code> works, I saw this timely tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">David Robinson</a></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function<br><br>When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post
</p>
